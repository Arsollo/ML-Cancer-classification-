# Comp432-GroupP: 
This is a machine learning project for the Concordia class COMP-432.<br>
The project consists of training and using pre-trained machine learning models in order to solve a classification problem. <br>
### Three Differents datasets were provided for this project: 
Dataset 1 (Colorectal Cancer Classification): https://zenodo.org/records/1214456 <br>
Dataset 2 (Prostate Cancer Classification): https://zenodo.org/records/4789576 <br>
Dataset 3 (Animal Faces Classification): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/animal-faces <br>

### Project's main goal
The goal of the project is to train a CNN ResNet-18 model on Datset #1 and applying that same model on Dataset #2 & Dataset #3. Next, another CNN model from the pytorch library was chosen (ImageNet) and was applied on Dataset #2 & Dataset #3. The CNN model that we built oursleves as well as the pytorch CNN model are then to be compared in order to reprt their different performances in terms of loss and accuracy. To help with the comparison, different classification reports for both training and testing are produced as well as plots showing the performance of the model at each training epoch. <br><br>
Next, the output features of the CNN encoders is analyzed with t-SNE as well as the following two machine learning techniques: K-nearest neighbour clustering and SVM.
